                                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
                            document.
                            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em style="font-weight: bolder;">Hyper Text:</em>
                                HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em style="font-weight: bolder;">Markup language:</em>
                                A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em style="font-weight: bolder;">Web Page:</em>
                                A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.</p>

                            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on
                            a screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control
                            the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

                                JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. 
                                It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
                                Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time.
                                The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. 
                                The name was suggested and provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market.
                                In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.
